## Background:
Computer viruses are a major threat to computer security. Viruses can be spread through a variety of means, such as email attachments, infected websites, and removable media. Once a virus infects a computer, it can cause a variety of problems, including data loss, system crashes, and even theft of personal information.

There are a number of antivirus programs available that can help to protect computers from viruses. However, even the best antivirus programs can fail to detect some viruses. This is because viruses are constantly evolving, and antivirus programs must be updated regularly to keep up with the latest threats.

In addition to antivirus programs, there are a number of other security practices that users can follow to protect your computers from viruses, such as avoiding untrusted websites and email attachments, and keeping your software up to date. However, even users sometimes who follow all of the best security practices can still fall victim to a virus.
